# 🎮 Pallanguzhi – Traditional Tamil Board Game

A web-based recreation of Pallanguzhi, a traditional two-player mancala game played in South India. Built with ❤️ using HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

## 🧠 What is Pallanguzhi?

Pallanguzhi is a centuries-old two-player pit-and-seed strategy game, played on a wooden board with 14 pits. It's like chess meets counting — and pure South Indian brilliance.

**Your mission:** Outsmart your opponent by tactically sowing and capturing seeds.  
**Your tools:** A slick modern interface, smooth animations, and solid logic.
