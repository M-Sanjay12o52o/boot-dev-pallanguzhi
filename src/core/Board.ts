// Pallankuli (Aluguli Mane) Game Rules - Based on the provided video and common variations

// Core Game Elements:
// - 2 players
// - 14 pits (or "houses"): 7 active pits per player (total 14)
// - Starts with 5 seeds in each of the 14 active pits. (Total 70 seeds at start of a round).

// How to Play
// 1. In turns, a player picks up all the BEADs from any of the holes on their side of
//    the board and redistributes them 1 BEAD per hole in counter-clockwise direction,
//    including onto spaces on their opponentâ€™s side of the board.
// 2. Captures happen when the play space next to the last BEAD redistributed is empty.
//    The player captures all the BEADs in the hole after the empty hole, and all
//    the BEADs in the space opposite the hole BEADs were captured from. If the space
//    next to the last BEAD redistributed is empty and at the end of a row, the player
//    will have only one pit to capture the BEADs from.
// 3. If a capture cannot be made the same player starts redistributing BEADs from the
//    next play space and continues in the same direction.
// 4. If while distributing the BEADs the total number of BEADs in a hole becomes 4 the
//    player captures it respectively to their sides.
// 5. After the second redistribution, the turn is over regardless of whether a player
//    has made a capture or not.
// 6. Play continues until all the BEADs have been captured.

  }

    // Game logic: sow seeds and update `pits`, `captured`
